The choice of method depends on the complexity of the task and the specific requirements of the scraping project. Here are some common methods used for web scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Expressions (Regex): Regular expressions are used to extract specific patterns of text from HTML content. While powerful, regex can be complex and fragile when dealing with complex web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML Parsing with Libraries: Programming languages like Python provide libraries such as Beautiful Soup and lxml, which can parse HTML and XML documents to extract data. These libraries make it easier to navigate the DOM (Document Object Model) of web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs: Some websites offer APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to access data in a structured and efficient manner. API requests can be made to retrieve data in JSON or XML format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning: Machine learning models can be trained to recognize and extract specific data patterns from web pages. This approach is particularly useful for unstructured data extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "CAPTCHA Solving: Some websites use CAPTCHA challenges to deter scraping. CAPTCHA solving services or custom scripts can be employed to automate CAPTCHA solving, although this may raise ethical and legal concerns."
